VARIABLES:
        A variable is a container that stores a value.

- This is very similar to the containers used to store rice, oats ane all. [EXAMPLE]

=> In JavaScript, there are three different variable keywords:
        1. var
        2. let
        3. const

-> Each variable keyword acts differently, so it's important to know how they will affect your code.

-> var is globally scoped while let & const are block scoped.

-> The value of a JavaScript variable can be changed during the execution of a program.



1. var:
- The var keyword is used to declare variables since JavaScript was created.
- Variables defined with 'var'
        * must be declared before use.
            keyword variable_name = 'value';

            var a = 7;
                here,   var : keyword
                        a   : identifier
                        =   : assignment operator
                        7   : literal
 
        * can be redeclared.
            keyword variable_name = 'value';

        * can be change the value.
            variable_name = 'value';

2. let:
- Variables defined with 'let'
        * must be declared before use.
        * can not be redeclared.
        * can be change the value.

3. const:
- The const keyword is used to declare constants in JavaScript. 
- const must be initialized during declaration unlike let and var.
- Once a constant is defined, it cannot be reassigned
- Variables defined with 'var'
        * must be declared before use.
        * can not be redeclared.
        * can not be change the value.
