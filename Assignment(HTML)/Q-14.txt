      ----------------------------------------------------

-> <span> is an inline tag, this gives us the text formate.
-> A <span> element which is used to color a part of text.

i.e.
<p> My Mother has <span style="color:blue> blue </span> eyes. </p>

-> The <span> tag is used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

   <span> is an inline element.
