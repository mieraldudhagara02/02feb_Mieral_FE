Q-4. What are HTML Entities?
     -----------------------

-> An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a 
   semicolon (;).
-> Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters 
   [Which would otherwise  be interprited as HTML code]
   and invisible characters [like non-breaking spaces]

-> Many characters have memorable entities.
   i.e.
   The entity for Copyright symbol is &copy;
                                      ------

-> Less memorable characters,
   i.e.
   &#8212; is for reference chart.
   -------

-> Some special characters are reserved for use in HTML, meaning that your browser will analyze them
   as HTML code.

   For example:
   if you use the less-than (<) sign, the browser interprets any text that follows as a tag.
-> To dispaly these characters as text, replace them with their corresponding character entities.
   i.e.
   & : &emp;
   < : &lt;
   > : &gt;
   " : &quot;
