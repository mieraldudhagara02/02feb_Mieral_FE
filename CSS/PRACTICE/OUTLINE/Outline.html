        An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the borders, to make the element "stand out".<br><br>

        The outline property is a shorthand property for:<br>

        * outline-width<br>
        * outline-style (required)<br>
        * outline-color<br><br>
        If outline-color is omitted, the color applied will be the color of the text.<br><br><br>
        <b><u>Note:</u></b> Outlines differ from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. The element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.
