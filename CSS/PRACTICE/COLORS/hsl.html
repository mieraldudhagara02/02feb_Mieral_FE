         * Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.
         * 100% is pure color, no shades of gray.
         * 50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.
         * 0% is completely gray; you can no longer see the color. -->

         <!-- Lightness
              * The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 
                50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light) and 100% means full lightness (white). -->
