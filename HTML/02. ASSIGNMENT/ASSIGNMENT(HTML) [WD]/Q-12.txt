Q-12. How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?
      ----------------------------------

- HTML links are hyperlinks.

- You can click on a link and jump to another document.

- When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

- A link does not have to be text. 
  A link can be an image or any other HTML element!

- The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. 

SYNTAX:
------
<a href="URL" target="value"> link text </a> 

- The most important attribute of the <a> element is the "href" attribute, 
  which indicates the link's destination.

- The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

- Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

-> By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

- An unvisited link is underlined and blue
- A visited link is underlined and purple
- An active link is underlined and red

-> The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

_self   - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank  - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top    - Opens the document in the full body of the window

Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs

Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL 4
(without the "https://www" part):
