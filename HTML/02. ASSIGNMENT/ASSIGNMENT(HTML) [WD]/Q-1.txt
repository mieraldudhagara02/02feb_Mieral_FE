Q-1. Are the HTML Tags and Elements the same things?
     -----------------------------------------------

->  HTML Tags and Elements are sometimes perceived as the same. However, they are not. 
->  There is a subtle difference between HTML Elements and HTML Tags that many people aren't aware of.

HTML TAGS:
---------
->  HTML Tags, They tell the browser how it should display content to the user. 
->  A tag starts with a < bracket and ends with a > bracket. 
->  Most tags exist in pairs in HTML. 
->  Tags have an opening and closing part. 
->  They are similar, except the closing part has a / sign after the opening bracket.

Syntax:
------
Opening tag: <TagName>
Closing tag: </TagName>



HTML ELEMENTS:
-------------
->  HTML Element includes a start tag, content, and an end tag.
->  The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
    <tagname> Content </tagname>

Examples of some HTML elements:
- <h1>My First Heading</h1>
- <p>My first paragraph.</p>



HTML ELEMENTS VS. HTML TAGS:
---------------------------
->  HTML Tags usually exist in pairs consisting of a starting and an ending tag. 
    However, some tags do not have a closing tag.
->  HTML Elements contain a starting tag, content, and an ending tag. 
    If there is no content in an HTML Element, it is called an Empty HTML Element.
