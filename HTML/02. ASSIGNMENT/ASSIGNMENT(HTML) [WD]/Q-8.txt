Q-8. What are the various formatting tags in HTML?
     ---------------------------------------------

->  HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.

HTML FORMATTING TAGS:
--------------------
- Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text.

<b> - Bold text : The HTML <b> Tag defines bold text

<strong> - Important text : The HTML <strong> Tag defines bold text

<i> - Italic text : The content inside the <i> Tag is displayed in Italic Text

<em> - Emphasized text : The content inside the <i> Tag is displayed in Italic Text

<mark> - Marked text : The HTML <mark> Tag defines text that should be highlighted
 
<small> - Smaller text : The HTML <small> Tag defines smaller text

<del> - Deleted text : The HTML <del> Tag defines text that has been deleted from a document. 
                      - Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text 
<sub> - Subscript text : The HTML <sub> element defines subscript text. 
                        - Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line and is sometimes 
                          rendered in a smaller font. 
                        - Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas.

<sup> - Superscript text : The HTML <sup> element defines superscript text. 
                          - Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, 
                            and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. 
                          - Superscript text can be used for footnotes.

-> Thus, these all are the Formatting Tags.
