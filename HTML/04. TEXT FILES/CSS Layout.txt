CSS Layout:
----------

--> float:-

The CSS 'float' property specifies how an element should float.

The 'float' property is used for positioning and formatting content.

EXAMPLE:
-> let an image float to the text in a container.

The 'float' property can have one of the following values:
* left  : The element floats to the left of its container
* right : The element floats to the right of its container
* none  : The element does not float. This is default.
          [will be displayed just where it occurs in the text]

In its simplest use,
the 'float' property can be used to wrap text around images.
